# Agricultural Sprinkler System Optimization Tool

## Overview

Efficient irrigation is a cornerstone of modern agriculture, directly impacting crop yield, resource conservation, and overall farm sustainability. However, the automation and optimization of agricultural irrigation systems remain significantly underexplored, leaving many farmers without adequate tools to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.

This project addresses this gap by providing a solution for planning and optimizing agricultural sprinkler systems. It calculates the optimal placement of sprinklers within a field based on user-defined parameters, such as field dimensions, obstacle coordinates, and desired irrigation precision. By tailoring the sprinkler configuration to the specific layout and needs of the field, the system ensures even water distribution and efficient resource usage.

The system also generates a comprehensive PDF report, offering:

- Recommendations on the types of sprinklers to use.  
- Precise locations for sprinkler installation.  
- Justifications for the chosen configuration.  
- An estimated cost for the entire sprinkler system.  

By automating complex calculations and consolidating insights into an actionable report, this tool simplifies the design process for farmers and agricultural planners. It empowers users to adopt irrigation systems that are both cost-effective and highly efficient, addressing a critical yet overlooked challenge in the agricultural sector.

### - **Field Boundary Points**
   A list of tuples representing the boundary points of the field. Each tuple must contain two values: `(latitude, longitude)` in the EPSG:4326 coordinate system (WGS 84). The boundary points define the area to be irrigated.

   **Example:**
      ```python
      field_coordinates = [(40.32897891010581, -8.653877052022354), (40.32879283914316, -8.654454588726981), (40.32871683817989, -8.654719293049935), (40.328673596214294, -8.654879146959251), (40.328566146359954, -8.655171353054081), (40.328555374264695, -8.655347460383402), (40.32846503629598, -8.655627046067496), (40.32840434040056, -8.655762210033197), (40.32836340593132, -8.655858491213378),  (40.328280125383884, -8.655480772805728),
      (40.32830976762442, -8.655345608865737), (40.328380344335166, -8.654999366992056),
      (40.32850032457668, -8.654419828401345), (40.32860901237369, -8.653973602243287), (40.328704996258885, -8.653592180685843), (40.328875790774305, -8.653744008662159)]

### - **Obstacle Points**
   A list of dictionaries representing obstacles within the field. Each dictionary must contain the following keys:
    "format_type": A string that defines the shape of the obstacle. Only two values are accepted: "rectangle" or "circle".
    "coordinates": A tuple specifying the central point of the obstacle, formatted as (latitude, longitude).
    "radius": An integer specifying the radius of the obstacle (in meters). This value applies only for circular obstacles. For rectangular obstacles, set this value to None.
   
   **Example:**
      ```python
      obstacles = [
         {"format_type": "circle", "coordinates": (40.32850461030154, -8.654941160992928), "radius": 20},
         {"format_type": "rectangle", "coordinates":[(40.32864390701266, -8.654509663225632), (40.3287, -8.6552), (40.3292, -8.6552), (40.3292, -8.6547), (40.3287, -8.6547)], "radius": None}]

### - **Resolution**      
   Specify the level of precision required for the irrigation calculations. Higher precision will result in more detailed calculations and potentially longer processing times. Choose an appropriate level of precision based on the complexity of the field and the accuracy required for irrigation.

   Note: Increasing precision may extend the time required to process the data, so it is important to balance the desired accuracy with computational efficiency.

## 6. **Integration with GIS Tools for Complex Field Mapping**
   - Incorporate Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to support more complex field shapes and configurations, enabling precise mapping and management of irrigation systems, especially in non-rectangular fields or challenging terrains.

## 7. **Advanced Modeling for Terrain and Environmental Factors**
   - Implement advanced modeling techniques to account for factors such as uneven terrain, altitude variations, soil type, crop type, and water pressure dependencies. This will help optimize irrigation patterns and enhance resource efficiency.

## 8. **Cloud-Based Deployment for Real-Time Data Collection and Reporting**
   - Transition to a cloud-based deployment to facilitate real-time data collection and report sharing. Cloud integration will enable seamless data access, analytics, and collaboration among users and stakeholders, improving decision-making and reporting on irrigation performance.

These enhancements aim to create a more intelligent, efficient, and adaptable irrigation system that can better respond to dynamic environmental conditions, improve water usage efficiency, and maximize crop yield.
